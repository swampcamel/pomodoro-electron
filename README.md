#Pomodoro Clocks

## By Daniel Mace

### Description

This app was a sandbox for learning Electron with Create React App.  It allows you to generate up to 3 clocks set for 25 minutes.  It includes Start, Stop and Reset buttons for each clock.

This repository only contains the React side of the application.  It is utilizing another repo which is the electron side of it which you can find [here](https://github.com/swampcamel/electron-bootstrap).

### To Deploy

You will need NodeJS, Yarn and Electron installed globally to deploy.

Afterwards, clone both repos into a parent directory.  Name this cloned Repo's folder "renderer" and the bootstrapped repo "main".

Navigate to the renderer folder and run ```npm i``` then ```yarn start```

Open another terminal window and navigate to the main folder and run ```npm i``` then ```yarn start``` there as well.

That should do it!
